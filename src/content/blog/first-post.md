This is my first blog post. I'm still working on my personal website, it looks really bad now but I will work on styling
it as soon as possible with Tailwind and DaisyUI.

## Stack
For my personal website, I'm using Astro, Tailwind and DaisyUI. It's a very nice stack for creating the frontend. I don't
really know much about backend and honestly don't want to fiddle with it too much until I'm happy with the frontend which
is currently not the case ðŸ˜… This stack is very lightweight, performant and flexible and I just love it as a beginner
webdev. I'll call it the AstroTail stack just for fun but call it whatever you wish.
