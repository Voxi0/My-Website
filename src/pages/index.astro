			<h2>Hi!</h2>
			<p>
        I'm a {identity.age}yo student and a Linux/Nix enthusiast currently living in the United Kingdom. I was born in Bangladesh and
        lived there for about 13 years before I came to the United Kingdom on 30<sup>th</sup> September 2022.

        <br><br>
        I know Bengali as it's my native language and English. Many people assume I'm American because I supposedly have a very
        American accent. But I've never travelled countries before coming to the UK ðŸ˜…

        <br><br>
        I have been using Linux ever since I came to the UK. Since then I learned a lot about Linux and programming in general and also
        became a terminal addict. I have Neovim pretty much all the time and I'm also planning to check out Emacs someday
        because it seems really cool :P

        <br><br>
        I love gaming but not as much as I used  to. My favourite games has definitely got to be Psychopomp, Spooky's Jumpscare Mansion,
        Half Life 1/2, Ghost of Tsushima, Minecraft and Evade or Phantom Forces on Roblox. As you can tell, I love playing somewhat relaxed
        games. I highly prioritize the story/lore of a game over all other aspects.
      
        <br><br>
        I also love watching movies and TV shows. I usually watch them with my dad. I'm not gonna list my favourites as there's far
        too many but some of my favourite shows are <strong>Breaking Bad and Rick and Morty</strong>. I plan on watching Better Call
        Saul soon. I really like horror although I get scared really easily ðŸ˜…
